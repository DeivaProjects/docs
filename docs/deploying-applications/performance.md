Over the years we have built Octopus to enable reliable and repeatable deployments, but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be slow. In fact, Octopus can scale with you as you grow. Octopus is a complex system with a core component allowing you to run your own custom scripts. We work hard to ensure all the parts we control work quickly and efficiently leaving as many resources as possible for running your deployments. That being said, there are many things you can do to ensure your Octopus deployments execute efficiently.

This page is intended to help you tune and maintain your deployment processes and troubleshoot problems as they occur.

## Key considerations

By the time your deployment starts, the Octopus API and database are no longer the bottleneck. The key concerns are now:

- The throughput and reliability of the connection from Octopus Server to your deployment targets
- The speed and reliability of your deployment targets themselves
- The number of steps in your deployment process
- The size and number of packages you are deploying
- How your packages are acquired/transferred to your deployment targets
- How many deployment targets you deploy to in parallel
- Whether your steps run serially (one-after-the-other) or in parallel (at the same time)
- The amount and size of log messages you write during deployment
- The number and size of your variables
- Other processes on the deployment target interfering with your deployment

## Tips

We don't offer a one-size-fits-all approach to optimizing your deployments using Octopus: every deployment scenario is unique. Instead we recommend taking an experimental approach to optimization: measure-then-cut. Record your deployments, make an adjustment, then measure again, etc. These tips should give you enough information to get started.

### Optimize the connection to your deployment targets

If you have a reliable, high throughput connection between your Octopus Server and deployment targets, your deployments can go fast. Unfortunately the opposite is also true:

- Low throughput connections make package acquisition and deployment orchestration slow.
- An unreliable connection can make deployments slow through dropped connections and unnecessary retries.

A reliable connection to your deployment targets is the foundation of reliable and fast deployments. If bandwidth/throughput is genuinely an invariant, you may want to consider a way of acquiring your packages prior to the deployment starting, leaving the bandwidth available for deployment orchestration.

### Optimize your deployment targets

Fast and reliable deployment targets are also a foundation for fast and reliable deployments. This is one area where every deployment is different, but the key considerations are similar:

- If your deployment does a lot of work on the disk(s) make sure your disks have sufficient throughput/IOPS
- If your deployment does a lot of work in the CPU make sure your CPU has enough throughput/cores
- If your deployment does anything, make sure your deployment target isn't already saturated running your applications, or choose a time of lower usage

:::hint
If a particular operation seems slow during deployment, test that single operation on your deployment target without Octopus in the mix. Octopus adds as little overhead as possible to your deployments, so there's a good chance that operation is slow because of some kind of bottleneck on the deployment target itself.
