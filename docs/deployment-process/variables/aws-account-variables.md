AWS accounts are included in a project through a project variable of the type `Amazon Web Services Account`. Before you create an `AWS Account Variable`, you need to [create an AWS Account](/docs/infrastructure/aws/creating-an-aws-account/index.md) in Octopus.

![AWS Account Variable](aws-account-variable.png "width=500")

The `Add Variable` window is then displayed and lists all the AWS accounts.

Select the account that was created in the previous step to assign it to the variable.
