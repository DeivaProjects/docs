The combination of package ID and [version](versioning-in-octopus-deploy.md) will uniquely identify a package.

Package identifiers in Octopus follow similar rules to [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package#choosing-a-unique-package-identifier-and-setting-the-version-number). 

They must conform to the following specification:

1. Package IDs consist of one or more segments separated by one of the following separator characters: `-` `.` `_`

1. Segments contain only alphanumeric characters.

1. Must be unique within your Octopus Deploy instance

## Best Practice

We recommend naming your packages similar to namespaces in .NET. i.e. Pascal-cased and dot-separated.   

Recommended examples include:

- Acme
- Acme.Billing.Web

Also valid examples include:

- acme
- acme-billing.web
- Acme_Billing.Web
